I am a motivated individual who likes learning on my own time.  I enjoy tinkering with new technologies to keep my skills up to date.  I always take the opportunity to mentor others to share the knowledge I have learned over the years to save them some headaches and grief.  The thing I like most about my profession is that I learn something new every day.

> I like to develop with technologies such as javascript, html, css, javascript and frameworks like angular, vue and spring.

I have different code examples [on Github](https://github.com/davidjamesherzog) and [on Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/davidjherzog/).
